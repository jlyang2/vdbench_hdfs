 * This class is a Shutdown hook.
 *
 * There are two uses: - send a message to both stderr and stdout so that a JVM
 * that is waiting for it's completion in OS_cmd() gets a message, allowing any
 * outstanding BufferedReader.readLine() to complete.
 *
 * - Close any open report files. This is cheaper than using flush() for each
 * single report line written. With many luns and many slaves doing the flush
 * each time for each line for each interval just gets to be too expensive.
