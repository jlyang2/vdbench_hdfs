    I'll need FileEntry and Directory instances to allow code sharing.
    Using ActiveFile requires me to have an anchor?
    I could define 'n' anchors and that will then be the process count?
    I can even have the anchor contain 1800 FileEntries and that then can give
    me the file count and the file size!

    All the non-100mb files can just be fileentries outside of the anchor.
    I don't think they have to be in the anchor.

    I can use the FwgEntry belonging to this thread (needed by ActiveFile())

    ActiveFile does o/c/r/w, I can add a copy() if needed.
